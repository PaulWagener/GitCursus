Once upon a time Pedro was a pediatrist. He loved pancakes and taking trips to Paris.
For the first time in a long time Pedro walked the plank, he had a parrot on his shoulder and
was wearing puffy pants.

The end.



Pedro's Story:
The edge-to-edge top-to-bottom Super Retina display adopts OLED technology for true-to-life colors, deep blacks, and a million-to-one contrast ratio. It features a 2436 x 1125 resolution and 458 pixels per inch, the highest resolution and pixel density ever introduced in an iPhone. It supports HDR, wide color, 3D Touch, and True Tone for adjusting the white balance of the display to match the ambient lighting.
